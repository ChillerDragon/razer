This is a configuration utility for Razer devices on Linux systems.

*** DEPENDENCIES ***

 * python
   http://www.python.org/

 * libusb
   http://libusb.sourceforge.net/

 * QT4 (for the graphical qrazercfg tool only)
   http://www.trollech.com/

 * cmake (for building only)
   http://www.cmake.org/

Note that almost all distributions ship prebuilt packages of the
above dependencies.

*** BUILDING ***

First invoke "cmake" to build the makefiles.
Then invoke "make" to build the binaries.

  cmake .
  make

(Note the required space and dot after the cmake command)

*** INSTALLING ***

  make install

*** UDEV / AUTOMATIC CONFIGURATION ***

The file "01-razer-udev.rules" in this package contains example rules
on how to handle automatic configuration through udev.
On Ubuntu Linux you need to
   cp 01-razer-udev.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/01-razer.rules
to install the rules. Note that you might have to adjust the RUN path in
the .rules file, if you didn't install the stuff to /usr/local.

*** DISTRIBUTIONS ***

Distributions should install a proper udev autoconfig rule file
from their rpm or deb (or whatever) install scripts.
See 01-razer-udev.rules for example rules.
